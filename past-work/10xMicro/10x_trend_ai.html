                <div class="page-text">
                  <p>There&rsquo;s an old business joke about a  down-and-out entrepreneur who is asked how he went bankrupt.</p>
                  <p>&ldquo;<em>Gradually</em>,&rdquo;  he replies. &ldquo;<em>Then suddenly</em>.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>So much of the change in our lives is of  the &ldquo;gradually, then suddenly&rdquo; variety. A long series of tiny, gradual changes  alter our world, yet we barely notice them… until we wake up one day and  realize a <u>massive</u> change has taken place. </p>
                  <p>For example, a toddler changes a little  bit every day. The changes are hard to notice… and then the parent wakes up one  day and that chubby toddler is a skinny &ldquo;big kid&rdquo; off to kindergarten. Or, you  might be one of the hundreds of millions of people who started checking your  new smartphone a tiny bit more every day… and then you woke up one day and  realized you&rsquo;re addicted to the darn thing and on it all the time.</p>
                  <p>I&rsquo;m bringing up the &ldquo;<em>gradually, then suddenly</em>&rdquo; phenomenon with you today <u>because of  money</u>. </p>
                  <p>Right now, one of the world&rsquo;s most  powerful, most transformational technologies is <u>just starting</u> to change  the world in amazing ways. The radical change it will create in the future will  be one of the greatest wealth building opportunities of your life. I&rsquo;m talking  about an &ldquo;internet-sized&rdquo; or an &ldquo;Amazon-changes-retail-sized&rdquo; opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Play this opportunity right, and you&rsquo;ll be  able to retire much earlier than you thought possible… or be able to buy that  home on the water with cash.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, many people will miss this  once-a-decade opportunity. That&rsquo;s because the transformational change this  technology is creating is hard to spot. But trust me, one day millions of  people just like you will wake up and realize the way we shop, travel, work,  and play has massively changed… and they let the opportunity slip by.</p>
                  <p><strong><u>Don&rsquo;t  be one of them.</u></strong></p>
                  <p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the epic opportunity  in front of you…</p>
                  <h3>Why  Everything is About to Get Easier and More Efficient</h3>
                  <p>How much time did Excel save the human  race?</p>
                  <p>A billion years? Ten billion years?</p>
                  <p>Microsoft originally marketed a  spreadsheet program called Multiplan in 1982. This project morphed into Excel,  the first version of which was introduced in 1985. Excel is now the world&rsquo;s  most popular spreadsheet software. It has saved us stupendous amounts of time  by allowing us to automate calculations and financial analysis… instead of  doing single calculations by hand. One person running Excel can do the work of  a million accountants from days past.</p>
                  <p>That&rsquo;s the power of software. </p>
                  <p>Over the past 40 years, software has  created an explosion of efficiency and human productivity. Healthcare,  education, transportation, manufacturing, energy production, food production,  retail, banking, you name it – software programs have allowed us to do it much  more efficiently. The equivalent of Excel saving us a billion hours of tedious  work has occurred across all industries.</p>
                  <p>Given all the time, money, and frustration  software has saved us – and all the value it has created for individuals and  businesses – it&rsquo;s no wonder software leader Microsoft reached the mythic market  valuation of $1 trillion in 2019. </p>
                  <p>It&rsquo;s also no wonder software investors  have made more than 18,000% in business software leader Oracle… more than  4,000% in marketing software leader Salesforce.com… more than 8,100% in PDF  software leader Adobe Systems… and more than 34,000% in Microsoft (that&rsquo;s a  3,401-bagger return).</p>
                  <p>As advanced as software has become… as  much time and frustration it has saved the human race… you ain&rsquo;t seen nothing  yet. Software as we know it is about to take a quantum leap in power and  usefulness. <strong>That leap is thanks to artificial  intelligence</strong>.</p>
                  <h3>Artificial  Intelligence in a Nutshell</h3>
                  <p>By now, most people know the basics of artificial  intelligence. In a nutshell, &ldquo;AI&rdquo; is extremely powerful software running on  extremely powerful computers. Our hardware and software is becoming so powerful  that computers are starting to think for themselves. The implications are  incredible… and economically, they run into the trillions of dollars. </p>
                  <p>AI will create value for individuals and  businesses, changing the world just like conventional software has… only in a  bigger way. It will lead to stock market gains in the 4,000%-34,000% range,  just like conventional software has.</p>
                  <p>When I talk about the once-in-a-decade  investment opportunity that is AI, I often get shrugs. Although AI is  interesting – and the stocks related to it have 100-bagger potential – most  people don&rsquo;t see it at work every day in their lives. </p>
                  <p>However, AI is already in your life. Right  now, it is in the &ldquo;stealth change&rdquo; stage… making tiny gradual changes every  single day. For example…</p>
                  
                    <ul style="list-style:none;">
                        <li class="bullets green">Uber uses AI to dispatch drivers and  link them with customers.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Amazon uses AI to recommend potential  purchases to you.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Facebook uses AI to arrange and  customize its news feeds.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">The world&rsquo;s largest investment firms  are using AI to create and manage stock portfolios.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Airlines use AI to land planes.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Dating sites like Match.com use AI to  help people find potential soulmates.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Healthcare firms are using AI to scan  DNA, blood, and other test results to spot problems with greater accuracy than  human experts.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Recruiting firms are using AI to sift  through resumes and job applications and recommend the best candidates. No  humans needed.</li>
                        <li class="bullets green">Tesla&rsquo;s cars use AI for self-driving  functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                  <p>I could go on to list 100 more major AI  uses, but you get the idea. AI is already being used to save us money, time,  and frustration. For many people, AI is <strong>nowhere…  and everywhere</strong>. And one day, we&rsquo;ll wake up and realize it has massively  changed our world.</p>
                  <p>As an investor who knows how software&rsquo;s  ability to save us money, time, and frustration can lead to 100-fold investment  gains, I&rsquo;m so bullish on AI that I&rsquo;m foaming at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>AI could allow the U.S. to save hundreds  of billions of dollars in healthcare costs. It will lower the price of  electricity and food. In manufacturing, AI will anticipate needed machine  fixes, improve assembly line efficiency, and accelerate the product design  process. The savings here run into the hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
                  <p>Every business in every sector will  benefit from AI. Conventional software made us more efficient and lowered  prices. AI will do the same.</p>
                  <h3>How  Can I Invest in AI?</h3>
                  <p>Just like the early changes AI is  creating, AI stocks are tough to spot for the untrained eye. Many of the  biggest AI innovations are occurring inside the walls of giant technology firms  like Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM  (IBM).</p>
                  <p>While I believe AI could spur Alphabet and  Amazon to all-time highs in profits and market value appreciation, at gigantic  market caps north of $750 billion, those two companies are very unlikely to  grow 10X, 20X, or 30X their current size. </p>
                  <p>You can also consider companies involved  in manufacturing computer memory. Smart computers must have enormous amounts of  memory to store all the things they learn. Memory storage firm Micron is worth  a look here.</p>
                  <p>However, my preferred way to play AI is  through what I call &ldquo;AI stocks in disguise.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my term for small and  mid-cap software companies using AI to improve and transform their product  lineups. Some interesting names to check out are Upland Software, Domo, and  Model N.</p>
                  <p>I know, I know… &ldquo;software&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound  all that exciting.</p>
                  <p>But if you held a gun to my head and  forced me to pick just one kind of business to invest in for the next 20 years, <em>I&rsquo;d probably pick software</em>.</p>
                  <p>I understand why this concept doesn&rsquo;t make  people immediately sit up and take notice. A piece of software isn&rsquo;t tangible.  It&rsquo;s not something you can easily explain or hold in your hand. It&rsquo;s basically  a set of computer instructions. From a &ldquo;wow factor&rdquo; point of view, a software  program can&rsquo;t compete with a beautiful smartphone or a Tesla sports car. Being  a shareholder of software companies isn't something most folks rave about  during cookouts and cocktail parties.</p>
                  <p><u>But it should be.</u></p>
                  <p>I&rsquo;ve been analyzing and owning businesses  for over two decades now. I&rsquo;ve analyzed every kind of business under the sun. I  like to think I&rsquo;ve accumulated a great deal of experience and knowhow. And I  have to tell you, <u>I love the software</u> <u>business</u>. </p>
                  <p>I love the software business for the same  reason I prefer a home cooked meal made with fresh ingredients over a  McDonald&rsquo;s meal: I prefer – and appreciate – great quality.</p>
                  <p>Software businesses are among the most  profitable, highest-quality businesses on Earth. Plus, their products and  services can massively improve our lives. A great software program can help you  make smart business decisions, find travel deals, streamline business  communication, and get a cheap ride home. </p>
                  <p>The use of software can allow a business  to double and triple its profits. Software has massively improved our ability  to communicate, share information, transact, gather data, and analyze data. </p>
                  <p>Software businesses employ the power of  scalability in a way few other businesses can match. Scalability is the ability  of a business to massively grow revenues while minimally growing the costs  associated with producing those revenues. </p>
                  <p>For example, a lawn-mowing business is not  scalable. If you own a lawn-mowing business and want to double in size, you&rsquo;ll  have to buy twice as many lawn mowers as you have now, and you&rsquo;ll have to hire  twice as many lawn-mower operators as you have now. Because of this, your  revenue cannot soar far beyond your costs. </p>
                  <p>On the other side of the spectrum, you  have software businesses.</p>
                  <p>Once you spend the money to create a  useful software product or service, you can sell copies of it to the whole  world at very little additional cost. This often leads to giant profit margins  and giant market value appreciation.</p>
                  <p>It took a lot of work in the early days to  create the technologies and businesses behind software leaders like Microsoft  and Oracle. But once they were created, these two businesses could add new  users and increase their revenues much faster than they increased costs. Their  market values exploded higher as a result. </p>
                  <p>You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a business  that has generated more giant stock market winners that occurred in relatively  short time periods of time as the software business. You could think of the  software industry as a college sports team that produces more future All-Stars  than any other college team. Maybe there&rsquo;s something in the water (hint: it  tastes like scalability).</p>
                  <p>It's one thing for me to tell you about  the power of the software business model. But let me <u>show you</u> its power  as well. </p>
                  <p>Below is a chart that plots the  performance of the major software stock ETF, symbol IGV (blue line), versus the  performance of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index (orange line) since 2014. The  S&amp;P is up 52% over the past five years. The software ETF – full of  scalable, high-profit margin stocks – is up 170% during the same time… <u>over  triple the broad market&rsquo;s gains.</u></p>

                  <p>Thanks to the emerging power of AI, I  believe the world of small and mid-cap software stocks will prove to be a major  breeding ground for future 10X stock market winners. I have no doubt some of  the elite firms will rise more than 100-fold… just like the software leaders  that emerged in the 1990s did.</p>
                  <h3>Summing  Up</h3>
                  <p><em>Gradually…  then suddenly. </em></p>
                  <p>That&rsquo;s how many of the biggest changes in  our world occur. That&rsquo;s how I believe most people will view the massive change  AI brings.</p>
                  <p>Just like conventional software saved us  massive amounts of time, money, and frustration, AI will do the same. Just like  conventional software drove some elite firms to 100X-plus stock gains, AI will  do the same. I encourage you to see it as one of the greatest wealth building  opportunities of your life. Don&rsquo;t let it pass you by.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
