                  <p>In the pages of my <em>Early Stage Investor</em> service, readers often hear the term &ldquo;10X.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>As a rule of thumb, our early stage,  &ldquo;venture capital&rdquo; style investments are only in industries with the real  potential to grow 10-fold (or &ldquo;10X&rdquo;) in size. </p>
                  <p>Investing in industries with huge growth  potential and gale-force tailwinds at their backs is how you set yourself up to  make giant returns. Think of the internet in the 1990s… personal computers in  the 1980s… and smartphones over the past decade.</p>
                  <p>However, in a research report I recently  sent to readers, I detailed an industry set for not just 10X growth… not 20X  growth… and not even 50X growth… <strong>but at  least 100X growth.</strong>This is undoubtedly one of the best early stage  investment opportunities you&rsquo;ll ever see in your life. Best of all, we get to  partner with one of the world&rsquo;s most powerful wealth creating groups, one with  a stunning track record.</p>
                  <p>If you&rsquo;ve been a Stansberry Research  reader for a while, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to hear where this opportunity is  located. More on this in a moment. But first, let me show you some incredible  numbers…</p>
                  <h3>A Simple Case for Massive Returns</h3>
                  <p>Sometimes, investing is complicated. </p>
                  <p>Wall Street hedge funds and banks can create all kinds of  complex investments and strategies that only a math genius can make sense of.</p>
                  <p>However, sometimes making great investments is laughably simple.  That&rsquo;s the situation with the industry I&rsquo;ll share with you today.</p>
                  <p>The big opportunity here boils down to just one number...</p>
                  <p><strong>116</strong></p>
                  <p>Specifically, 116-fold growth is the targeted amount of growth  the Chinese government has planned for its biotechnology sector over the next  two years.</p>
                  <p>In 2017, the Chinese government announced that it intends to  make its domestic biotechnology sector constitute 4% of the country&rsquo;s Gross  Domestic Product (GDP) by 2020.</p>
                  <p>The Chinese economy is projected to be roughly $15.7 trillion in  size (as measured by GDP) by 2020. Right now, the revenue generated by China&rsquo;s  domestic biotech industry is a tiny $5.4 billion, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
                  <p>In order for China&rsquo;s biotech industry to constitute 4% of the  economy (which is $627 billion) by 2020, the industry must increase its sales  by 116-fold. </p>
                  <p>I&rsquo;ll explain what&rsquo;s happening below. But I&rsquo;d like you to keep  &ldquo;116-fold growth&rdquo; in the back of your mind. It&rsquo;s really all that matters here  when it comes to making hundreds of percent returns – even thousands of percent  returns – thanks to this unique situation.</p>
                  <h3>China is About to Create a  New Class of &ldquo;Champions&rdquo;</h3>
                  <p>China is well known for its large and growing capitalist  economy. In the 1970s and &rsquo;80s, China was extremely poor and undeveloped. But  thanks to capitalism, China is now the world&rsquo;s second largest economy.</p>
                  <p>China puts its own unique twist on capitalism. Although the  country is technically capitalistic, it&rsquo;s also authoritarian. The Chinese  government exerts a LOT more control over the economy and its domestic  companies than the U.S. government does. In order to allow its domestic  companies to grow large, the Chinese government often blocks U.S. companies  from doing business or gaining influence inside the country. For example,  Google and Facebook are not allowed in China.</p>
                  <p>China also likes to create &ldquo;national champions&rdquo;… huge companies  that have the implicit backing of the Chinese government. Competing with  China&rsquo;s &ldquo;champions&rdquo; inside China is extremely difficult and often impossible.</p>
                  <p>For decades, China focused on growing its &ldquo;basic&rdquo; industries  like manufacturing, mining, oil, shipping, and infrastructure building. China  did this in the 1990s and early 2000s so it could &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; to the rest of the  world with basic infrastructure. But now, the Chinese government is set on  fast-tracking high-tech industries like artificial intelligence, autonomous  vehicles, electric vehicles, e-commerce, and biotechnology. </p>
                  <p>China wants to compete on the highest levels – and dominate –  all the critical industries of the future. <strong>This  includes having a huge domestic biotechnology industry that develops and sells  the medical treatments and therapies of the future</strong>. </p>
                  <p>It makes sense. Medicine and healthcare are trillion dollar-plus  global industries. Plus, every government wants its population to be as healthy  and strong as possible (more taxpayers). The best, most affordable medicines  help make that happen.</p>
                  <p>History shows that when the Chinese government wants to create a  big industry in a short time, investors should take notice.</p>
                  <h3>The Chinese Government Has a Heck of a Track Record</h3>
                  <p>When the Chinese government says it&rsquo;s targeting one of its  domestic industries for massive growth, it pays to listen. Its track record of  creating huge returns for investors is impressive.</p>
                  <p>Starting in the late 1990s, the Chinese government went on an  infrastructure building spree. It built dams, bridges, cities, power plants,  highways, and ports on a scale never seen before in history. All that building  consumed an incredible amount of natural resources like oil, coal, copper,  cement, and iron ore.</p>
                  <p>The big Chinese oil firm PetroChina was just one of the winners  during the infrastructure boom. PetroChina literally helped fuel China&rsquo;s  massive growth, and the stock grew 17X from its IPO in 2000 through the high in  2007. </p>
                  <p>If you think that&rsquo;s impressive, take a look at Anhui Conch  Cement. The company&rsquo;s stock was trading at a mere $0.17 per share in early  2000, and today it is around $50 per share. That&rsquo;s a 294-bagger! As you can  tell by the name, the company makes cement and aggregates used to build roads,  houses, etc. all over China.</p>
                  <p>Or consider the results of China&rsquo;s push to create a strong  domestic technology sector. This push began about 10 years ago. </p>
                  <p>One of the companies that enjoyed government support during that  time was a little known firm called Tencent Holdings. Tencent gathered assets and  extended its tentacles into many aspects of China&rsquo;s economy. It was a major  beneficiary of the government&rsquo;s backing. Today, Tencent Holdings is one of the  largest companies in the world. The stock rose an eye-popping 67,000% from its  IPO in 2004 through January 2018. </p>
                  <p>From an investing point of view, overzealous government spending  in China is a good thing. Even if the goals are too lofty, there is no denying  the power of the Chinese government and how its backing can boost an entire  industry and related stocks. </p>
                  <p>Now you see why I paid close attention when I learned how  strongly the Chinese government is pushing its biotech industry. It is  determined to put the industry on the same level with U.S. biotech… and do it  in just a few years. This will require the Chinese biotech industry to grow  more than 100-fold. </p>
                  <p>I believe the Chinese government&rsquo;s public relations team got  carried away by saying they want that enormous growth by 2020. I think five to  seven years is more realistic. But 100-fold growth in even 10 years will make  the Chinese biotechnology sector one of the greatest growth stories in modern  history. I&rsquo;m willing to be patient for life-changing returns.</p>
                  <h3>The Catalysts That Will Drive Chinese Biotech Stocks Much Higher</h3>
                  <p>Investing in a small industry backed by the Chinese government  is a recipe for huge returns. However, I want to see more than just the backing  of a sometimes unpredictable government.&nbsp;Here are nine more reasons why I  believe investing in Chinese biotech stocks will be one of the best  wealth-building opportunities of the next 20 years.</p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #1: China&rsquo;s Version of the FDA</h4>
                  <p>The National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA),  that country&rsquo;s version of the FDA that approves drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics,  has transformed itself to be on par with its peers in the U.S. and Europe. With  the NMPA&rsquo;s newfound respect, the Chinese biotech industry can now be taken  seriously by the rest of the world. This opens the door for approved drugs in  China to quickly spread to the U.S. and Europe. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #2: Demographics</h4>
                  <p>China&rsquo;s massive population of nearly 1.4 billion people unfortunately  means greater numbers of people who are sick. Twenty percent of the world lives  in China, but it has 30% of all cancer patients, so the government is funding  massive research into cancer treatments. China&rsquo;s population is also aging.  Given the huge need for drugs over the next decade, simple economic theory  points to a big boom in Chinese biotech. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #3: Technology</h4>
                  <p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare  will lead to medical breakthroughs. By gaining more access to gene sequencing  data, AI computers will be able to create drugs faster based on recognized  patterns. China could be the best positioned country in the world because cutting  edge AI technology feeds off data, and China has vast amounts of health  information on its citizens with its looser privacy laws. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #4: Local Governments</h4>
                  <p>Local cities and territories in China are trying to attract  biotech firms. Think about the wealth that Silicon Valley created for  surrounding areas… or the research triangle in North Carolina. Cities are  already throwing out big incentives to Chinese biotech firms to set up shop in  their area. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #5: Diversifying the Economy</h4>
                  <p>Beijing has highlighted the pharma and biotech industries as two  that it wants to lead growth in the future. By depending less on the  export-driven manufacturing industry, it will lead to a bigger economic boom domestically.</p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #6: Talent</h4>
                  <p>In the past, China did not have enough educated scientists to  match other countries. That has quickly changed as more American-educated  Chinese are making their way back home. Similar to a tech firm in the U.S.  trying to lure talent from a competitor, China is also dangling carrots to  attract the world&rsquo;s top scientists through its China&rsquo;s Thousand Talents  Program. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #7: Gene Editing</h4>
                  <p>Gene editing is one of my favorite long-term investing themes  within the future of medicine. Scientists are working toward curing diseases  the same way you or I would make an edit while typing at our computers. China  had at least nine gene editing studies taking place as of the end of 2018. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #8: The Drug Trade</h4>
                  <p>For many years, Chinese companies would license drugs from their  large Western counterparts to sell in China. That is quickly changing. Chinese  biotech firms are starting to license their drugs to U.S.-based companies to  sell outside of China. </p>
                  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                    <h4>Catalyst #9: Just the Beginning</h4>
                  <p>I&rsquo;ve seen estimates that up to 100 Chinese biotech companies are  preparing to go public in the near future. I realize that seems insanely high,  but China&rsquo;s biotech companies used to be unable to list on a major Chinese  stock exchange unless they had revenue. That eliminated nearly all of them.  That rule has changed, allowing capital to flow into Chinese biotechs.</p>
                  <h3>Building Our Own China Biotech Basket</h3>
                  <p>One of our favorite strategies in <em>Early Stage Investor</em> is  what we call our &ldquo;buy a basket&rdquo; strategy, which is like building our own  exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is a must for the Chinese biotech sector.</p>
                  <p>As  you know, an ETF is a diversified investment fund that trades like a stock.  Most hold dozens or hundreds of different companies. They can give you  diversified exposure to a sector or country, and can be very useful investment  vehicles. </p>
                  <p>However,  because ETFs typically hold so many stocks, an ETF buyer is virtually  guaranteed to end up owning a lot of average companies (and even some crappy  ones). You get the bad with the good.</p>
                  <p>On  the other hand, if you want to profit from a big business or technological  innovation, you can try to buy one single stock.</p>
                  <p>Buying  a single stock can pay off massively. But doing so exposes you to significant  downside risk. If there is a major problem at your chosen company (like an  accounting scandal or a crazy management decision), you could suffer a big  loss. </p>
                  <p>That&rsquo;s  why I like taking the middle of the road approach when possible... which is  &ldquo;buy a basket.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>When  I say &ldquo;buy a basket,&rdquo; I mean pick three to six of the best companies in a  sector and buy all of them.  </p>
                  <p>By  purchasing a handful of the best companies, you avoid owning the weak players.  This gives you lots of upside potential while providing you with some  diversification. It&rsquo;s a smart way to invest in big themes that gives you an  excellent balance of risk and reward.</p>
                  <p>The upside potential of the Chinese biotech sector is difficult  to quantify, but you can see that it&rsquo;s big. If you are able to pick the  companies that create the next blockbuster drugs, the gains could be 50X your  original investment. It would be like buying U.S. biotech leader Amgen in the  late 1980s. You would have made 250 times your money.</p>
                  <p>I see Chinese biotechs as a little further along. I would say it  is more like getting into U.S. biotechs in the mid-1990s. You could buy Amgen  for $5 per share at that point, and today it is trading around $195. That 39X  return turns a $5,000 investment into $195,000.</p>
                  <p>Here&rsquo;s another way to grasp some of the upside potential. Amgen  has a $118 billion market cap and did $23.7 billion in sales in 2018. A few of  the companies we will put in our Chinese biotech basket could generate similar  sales in the next decade. We can buy these stocks when they are valued at $2-$4  billion.</p>
                  <p>The basket approach has worked well in the past with biotech  stocks. From the mid-1990s through the high in 2015, the Nasdaq Biotech Index  was up 28-fold. </p>
                  <h3>Summing Up</h3>
                  <p>Investing alongside the mandates of the  Chinese government is one of the world&rsquo;s most successful investment strategies.  When the Chinese government wants to create an industry, it does.</p>
                  <p>The Chinese government wants to dominate  biotechnology and healthcare over the coming decades. My suggestion is to take  the Chinese at their word… and own a basket of the best Chinese biotech stocks.  It&rsquo;s one of the top &ldquo;early stage&rdquo; opportunities around.</p>
