                <div class="page-text">
                  <p>On  August 2, 2018, Apple became the first American company to cross the threshold  of $1 trillion in market value.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s  a &ldquo;1&rdquo; with 12 zeros after it.</p>
                    <p>Apple&rsquo;s  crossing of that mark was a big, hyped event that made all the major news  outlets.</p>
                    <p>Less  hyped was the fact that three other companies were hot on Apple&rsquo;s heels in the  race to join the $1 trillion club. Amazon surged past that market cap a month  later on September 4, 2018. Microsoft joined the $1 trillion club in April of  this year. Another company with a good shot of being worth over $1 trillion  soon is Alphabet (Google&rsquo;s parent).</p>
                    <p>Think  about that list for a moment. There&rsquo;s no car maker on it. No big manufacturer  like General Electric. There&rsquo;s no oil company, no mining company, no steel  company, and no banking company.</p>
                    <p>The  market has spoken. Technology – with its ability to create smartphones,  software, time-saving apps, social media platforms, online shopping  experiences, and the like – is now the most dominant, most valued part of our  economy. Tech entrepreneurs and investors are making fortunes as a result.</p>
                    <p>If  Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are the tallest skyscrapers – the  commanding heights of our &ldquo;economic city&rdquo; – it&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say their  foundations rest on the bedrock of our communications grid… aka &ldquo;the internet.&rdquo;  Without this bedrock, those skyscrapers crash to the ground.</p>
                    <p>As  you read this, the next trillion-dollar companies – the next Amazon, the next Alphabet  (Google&rsquo;s parent company), etc. – are being hatched in research facilities and  garages around the world. These firms will change the world and revolutionize  our economy. If you follow technology even a little bit, you know what fields  these companies are in: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, virtual  reality/augmented reality, blockchain, mobile payments, and the Internet of  Things (IoT).</p>
                    <p>Just  like how the businesses of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft can&rsquo;t  function without the internet, the next generation of world-changing, $1  trillion mega winners can&rsquo;t survive without the subject of this essay. It&rsquo;s the  bedrock our future will rest on… and it&rsquo;s a giant investment opportunity.</p>
                    <h3>How Building Toll  Roads Can Make You a Millionaire</h3>
                    <p>One  way to view the internet buildout of the 1990s is as the construction of a vast  network of toll roads. </p>
                    <p>These  toll roads linked friend to friend… family member to family member… and most  importantly from a capitalist&rsquo;s point of view: business to consumer. Millions  upon millions of people wanted to send their messages, data, and advertisements  over the internet&rsquo;s toll roads. It was a communications revolution.</p>
                    <p>History shows building the revolution&rsquo;s toll roads was incredibly profitable.  Cisco, the leading maker of networking equipment, enjoyed a 34,000% increase in  market value during the 1990s. Intel, which made computer chips, saw its stock  soar more than 3,500% during the 1990s. EMC, which made data storage devices, saw its  shares advance more than 80,000%  during the 1990s.</p>
                    <p>As  incredible as the internet&rsquo;s first toll roads were, their size and capacity  pales in comparison to the next generation of toll roads… which will lead to  your doorstep soon. </p>
                    <p>They  go by the name of &ldquo;5G.&rdquo;</p>
                    <h3>You Ain&rsquo;t Seen  Nothing Yet</h3>
                    <p>The  path to the 5G wireless communications network began 45 years ago on Tuesday,  April 3, 1973.</p>
                    <p>Martin  Cooper, a senior engineer at Motorola, stood on 6th Ave. in Manhattan. He was  about to make the first cell phone call in history, and he was nervous about  whether it would work.</p>
                    <p>Martin  didn&rsquo;t call a family member, friend or even a co-worker. Instead, he called his  chief competitor, Dr. Joel Engle at Bell Labs. The two had been in a race to  get to this day first.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Joel,  this is Marty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling you from a cell phone, a real handheld  personal cell phone.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Consider  those the first words in the mobile communications revolution.</p>
                    <p>Mobile  phones were then introduced to the public nearly a decade later, and by the  1980s, cell phones were creeping into the cars of wealthier individuals. The  first devices weighed a couple of pounds and were bigger than your head – they  are referred to as &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; for a reason – but they did what had never been  done before. The <strong>first generation</strong> of  mobile technology kicked off the trend toward an increasingly connected world.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>second generation</strong> of networks (2G  and 2.5G) were introduced in the 1990s. They gave us the ability to text,  another step forward in communication. We now take texting for granted – a lot  of people text more than they make actual phone calls.</p>
                    <p>The  move into the new millennium was accompanied by the move to 3G, which brought  major advances in the speed and capabilities of cellular networks. With the <strong>third generation</strong>, devices were able to  access broadband technology, which made possible entertainment, web browsing,  and shopping on a mobile device. There is now a generation of people who find  it hard to believe that 20 years ago there was no Amazon app to instantly  reorder your toilet paper.</p>
                    <p>Just  as semiconductors were part of the infrastructure for the internet, they were  also the backbone of the move to 3G. As a result, chip stocks made big moves  during this era. Qualcomm (QCOM) rallied more than 1,000% in the 1990s ahead of  when 4G networks started to appear.</p>
                    <p>As  nice as it was to be able to browse the internet on your phone, the <strong>fourth generation</strong> of wireless  connectivity took mobile technology to another level with the ability to stream  video without waiting for buffering. It was more enjoyable, yes, but it also  opened up business opportunities for content companies.</p>
                    <p>Still,  the biggest advancement was real-time information, which led to the sharing  economy. Mobile devices could talk to other devices in real-time, connecting  people instantaneously. Without real-time data transfer there would be no Uber,  GrubHub, or any other app that relies on a fast connection.</p>
                    <p>Once  again, there were big investment returns in the 4G phase. Cell tower companies  were among those enjoying huge rallies. As more data was being transmitted with  the increasing use of video, new and better towers were required.</p>
                    <p>But  honestly, we haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet. The most advanced breakthrough of all  is right around the corner. Just as there were fortunes made in prior  generations, there will be big money made once again. In fact, I think the  opportunity is even bigger now because the leap ahead will drive some of the  most powerful tech trends the world has seen.</p>
                    <p>I  think of it as the next-generation toll road. The road to the future passes  through 5G, and it&rsquo;s time to set up our booth and start collecting.</p>
                    <h3>5G&rsquo;s Widespread  Impact</h3>
                    <p>The  next-generation network will take speeds to levels that seem almost  unimaginable.</p>
                    <p>How  fast?</p>
                    <p>Well,  5G will in theory increase the level of speed to match that of human reflexes,  so we&rsquo;re talking the blink of an eye, perhaps literally.</p>
                    <p>The  current 4G network clocks in at around 100 megabits per second, which is  extremely fast compared to 3G. But once 5G rolls out, that number jumps to  10,000 megabits per second – or <strong><u>100  times faster</u></strong> than the current speed.</p>
                    <p>To  be honest, my phone and iPad stream videos nearly flawlessly already, so why do  I even need the speed to be 100 times faster? It will eliminate those slow  connections we run into at times, which is nice, but what&rsquo;s really about to  happen is that phones and mobile devices are about to become mobile  supercomputers.</p>
                    <p>The  big breakthrough will be the ability to connect a lot more devices that share  large amounts of data in real-time. So if you think we live in a connected world  already, you haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet.</p>
                    <p>From  cloud storage to the Internet of Things to augmented reality (AR) and virtual  reality (VR), 5G will allow all of the most dominant tech trends of our time to  not only flourish but reach new heights.</p>
                    <h3>5G and the Future  of Transportation</h3>
                    <p>There  is one breakthrough industry in particular that cannot exist without 5G: autonomous  vehicles, or AVs.</p>
                    <p>Just  as investors who were able to get in early during prior transformational trends  profited to the tune of 20 to 50 times their money, the AV/5G mega-trend is one  current transformational trend that cannot be ignored.</p>
                    <p>When  a $7 trillion industry like transportation is completely transformed for the  first time in nearly a century, it will have huge ramifications. The full  rollout of the 5G network will provide the much-needed communications  infrastructure for auto manufacturers to introduce AVs to the masses.</p>
                    <p>Once  again, it&rsquo;s reliability and real-time data sharing that make it possible.</p>
                    <p>Imagine  a self-driving car traveling down the highway at 75 miles per hour and the  network suddenly experiences a 100-millisecond delay. In any other  circumstance, that delay would never be noticed, but it could be devastating in  an AV. It could result in the braking system stopping the vehicle 10 feet  beyond where it would have otherwise. That 10 extra feet could lead to a major  accident.</p>
                    <p>Future  AVs will essentially be data centers on wheels. The amount of data that will be  stored in the brain of the vehicle will be beyond what we can imagine.</p>
                    <p>Morgan  Stanley predicts that a 2050 AV will produce 40 terabytes (TBs) per hour.  Today, your iPhone produces data in the range of 1-2 gigabytes (GBs) per month.  That would mean a 2050 AV will produce about 20,000 times more data <u>in one  hour</u> than your iPhone currently produces <u>in an entire month</u>!</p>
                    <p>Such  enormous amounts of data will be required due to the number of decisions taking  place at all times. The AV will have to take in data from sensors surrounding  the vehicle and instantaneously decide when to accelerate, brake, turn, etc.  Not only will the vehicle need 5G for computing within itself, it will also be  talking to the sensors in other vehicles, the roads, cell towers, satellites,  and even smart cities.</p>
                    <p>The thought of vehicles &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to each other  makes me think of some pretty creepy sci-fi images. It also makes me think of  the movie <em>Cars</em>.</p>

                  <p>In reality, vehicles talking to each other will look nothing like the animated movie but more like the image below. Notice that everything in that picture has a sensor that is talking to the other sensors in the area. Even the man pushing the child in the stroller and the bicyclist are talking to the vehicles!</p>

                  <p>Toyota  has plans to deploy its vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure  (V2I) technology in the U.S. by 2021. Again, the rollout of V2V and V2I is  impossible without widespread 5G. The current 4G network is great for streaming  videos, but the speed and latency would create major safety issues for AVs.</p>
                    <h3>Get in Position  Now</h3>
                    <p>You  can see how 5G networks will pave the way for so many breakthrough innovations,  not just faster phones but in self-driving cars, smart homes and cities,  virtual reality, healthcare, and so much more.</p>
                    <p>When  exactly does all of this excitement happen?</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s  already starting.</p>
                    <p>You  may have seen advertising for 5G home internet service in limited cities. Some  of the early advertising from Verizon came under criticism for calling it that  because it doesn&rsquo;t operate on the agreed-upon 5G standard. That will come by  the end of this year, as it expands to other cities. Smartphone manufacturers are  already rolling out the first 5G-enabled phones.</p>
                    <p>So,  we&rsquo;re already seeing the very first stages, and the pace will only pick up from  here. That&rsquo;s true of the stock prices, too, which will move ahead of specific  developments. </p>
                    <p>Long-term  winners in this sector will be 5G gear makers like Nokia, 5G infrastructure  providers like Crown Castle, and specialized chip makers like Skyworks  Solutions. </p>
                    <p>Consider  this short list a jumping off point for 5G ideas, but by no means a complete or  static guide. The early days of any technological revolution are full of  change. My advice is to follow this sector closely, study it frequently for  emerging winners, and own a handful of companies to get a good blend of  risk/reward. </p>
                    <p>You&rsquo;ll  end up owning some of the world&rsquo;s most valuable toll roads… just like the  smartest investors of the 1990s did.</p>
                    <p>Regards,<br>
