					<h1>Financial Lockdown: Why We Are Entering One of the Greatest Inflationary Periods in American History</h1>
					<h2>By: Dr. David Eifrig</h2>
					<div class="executive-summary">
						<hr class="dark-blue" />
							<p>Welcome to the Power Gauge.</p>
							<p><a href="#" target="_blank">[SAMPLE LINK, real link disabled]</a>, if you haven’t already.</p>
							<p>Simply type in any of 4,000 different tickers and see exactly where the stock is most likely to go next. A chance to predict TOMORROW’s stock ratings on Wall Street... in any type of market.</p>
							<p>In a nutshell, here’s how it works:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If the Power Gauge rates the stock “<strong>BULLISH</strong>,” then the stock has a strong chance of shooting up in the coming weeks and months.</li>
								<li>If the Power Gauge rates the stock “<strong>NEUTRAL</strong>,” then the stock has a strong chance of drifting sideways in the coming weeks and months.</li>
								<li>If the Power Gauge rates the stock “<strong>BEARISH</strong>,” then the stock has a strong chance of plummeting in the coming weeks and months.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The Power Gauge is the culmination of my 50 years on Wall Street. It has pointed to a variety of winners… using a secret of the investment world I cover in <a href="https://marc2021.com/video.html" target="_blank">our special video series here.</a></p>
							<p>Take a look…</p>
							<p>Here’s just a snapshot of the gains our system has pointed to…</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>10,090% in 11 months</strong> on RIOT</li>
								<li><strong>3,060% in 9 months</strong> on VXRT</li>
								<li><strong>3,000% in 3 months</strong> on GME</li>
								<li><strong>1,900% in 18 months</strong> on RAD</li>
								<li><strong>1,050% in 4 months</strong> on OSTK</li>
								<li><strong>900%</strong> on AAPL</li>
								<li><strong>884% in 8+ months</strong> on NIO</li>
								<li><strong>799% in 9+ months</strong> on FLGT</li>
								<li><strong>789% in 8 months</strong> on APPS</li>
								<li><strong>788% max gain in 24 hours</strong> on PCLN</li>
								<li><strong>697%</strong> on LAM</li>
								<li><strong>530%</strong> on CROX</li>
								<li><strong>410%</strong> on ENTG</li>
								<li><strong>399%</strong> on PEGA</li>
								<li><strong>383% in 10 months</strong> on VIAC</li>
								<li><strong>335% in 2 months</strong> on NVAX</li>
								<li><strong>277%</strong> on NOVT</li>
								<li><strong>258% in 6 months</strong> on CPRI</li>
								<li><strong>256%</strong> on KBH</li>
								<li><strong>244% in 2 months</strong> on CGIX</li>
								<li><strong>238% in 6 months</strong> on DISC</li>
								<li><strong>227%</strong> on CMG</li>
								<li><strong>136% gain in 8 months</strong> on YY</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In short, I’m best known as the creator of one of Wall Street’s most popular indicators… a system that appears in every Bloomberg and Reuters terminal in the world, and is now used by hundreds of banks, hedge funds, and every major brokerage site.</p>
							<p>For decades, I used it to help banks grow wealthier.</p>
							<p>But then the Crash of 2008 came along…</p>
							<p>And something happened that rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
							<p>My wife lost around 50% of her 401(k)… all because of a bad money manager.</p>
							<p>I thought… “Gee, I’ve spent my whole life helping Wall Street get richer… when ordinary folks like my wife Sandy are getting fleeced.”</p>
							<p>And that’s when I made a radical decision that yanked me out of retirement and has kept me working 24/7 for the last decade now… creating what I consider the ultimate “secret power” for everyday people.</p>
							<p>A way to see which stocks could soon double your money, by taking the same information I gave Wall Street for 50 years… and using it to give yourself a <em>HUGE and “unfair” advantage.</em></p>
							<p>Until May 25, I’m giving you a “lite” version of the Power Gauge to try this yourself on as many stocks as you like.</p>
							<p>Here are 3 stocks to get you started…</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section class="main-body" id="stockOne">
					<h4>STOCK #1: Tecnoglass (TGLS)</h4>
				<p>Type this stock into the Power Gauge right now…</p>
				<p>And you’ll see the rating is listed as <strong>BULLISH.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Tecnoglass</strong> is a little-known architectural glass maker that has been benefitting from the ongoing housing boom.</p>
				<p>The stock recently shot up 30% after reporting strong 1<sup>st</sup> quarter earnings.</p>
				<p>But I think that’s only the beginning.</p>
				<p>According to the Power Gauge, this stock could soon be rated a “Buy” at every major bank and hedge fund… which means this company is likely to shoot up in the coming weeks and months.</p>
					<p class="indent">Because the fact is, nothing makes a stock go UP or DOWN – faster – than the actions of institutional investors.</p>
				<p>When a bank starts pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars into a stock, it can shoot up overnight and go on to rise hundreds… or even thousands of percent… all because of the sheer quantity of institutional money flowing in.</p>
				<p>On May 25<sup>th</sup>, I’ll explain exactly how the Power Gauge works to predict these huge stock moves in our special event, <em>Prediction 2021</em>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-body" id="stockTwo">
					<h4>STOCK #2: Expedia Group (EXPE)</h4>
					<p>Type this stock into the Power Gauge right now…</p>
					<p>And you’ll see the rating is listed as <strong>NEUTRAL.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Expedia Group</strong> is an online travel company. To some people, it seems like a fantastic stock idea right now… a play on America’s “reopening.”</p>
					<p>After all, people are beginning to eat out in restaurants again, visit with family and take vacations.</p>
					<p>But according to the Power Gauge, this stock is headed nowhere.</p>
					<p>In fact, the Power Gauge is threatening to turn Bearish on the stock any day now.</p>
					<p>Expedia is a good example of how the Power Gauge can identify “popular” stock ideas… and expose them as money traps.</p>
					<p>That’s how I once warned the public to avoid the beloved fast-food firm Chipotle before it fell as much as 41%.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-body" id="stockThree">
					<h4>STOCK #3: Peleton Interactive (PTON)</h4>
					<p>Type this stock into the Power Gauge right now…</p>
					<p>And you’ll see the rating is listed as <strong>BEARISH.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Peleton</strong> is an exercise-bike company.</p>
					<p>Last year, it was a classic “pandemic play.” Gyms were closed and people were buying expensive exercise bikes for home use.</p>
					<p>But the Power Gauge turned bearish on Peleton back in mid-February and the stock has been falling ever since.</p>
					<p>And I think that’s only the beginning.</p>
					<p>According to the Power Gauge, this stock could soon be rated a “Sell” at every major bank and hedge fund… which means this company is likely to become one of the biggest losers of 2021.</p>
					<p>In fact, the company just got hit with a huge recall of their treadmills.</p>
					<p>This – coupled with the fact that investors are now pivoting from “pandemic plays” to “reopening plays” – means that you should AVOID Peleton right now. If you own it, get out immediately.</p>
					<p>Finding bearish stocks is how I once appeared on CNBC <em>Fast Money</em> back in 2014 and warned the public about Priceline.com, just before the stock plummeted. A friend of mine reported seeing a <em>733% overnight gain</em> on a single play he came across, by using my prediction.</p>

				<section class="main-body" id="specialEvent">
					<h4>Our special event on May 25</h4>
					<p>In our <em>Prediction 2021</em> event on Tuesday, May 25 at 8pm ET, I’ll walk you through how the Power Gauge works.</p>
					<p>I’ll give away my #1 little stock to buy now, for 500% potential upside…</p>
					<p>And most important of all, I’ll make the biggest prediction of my 50-year career.</p>
					<p>I’ll name a new type of company I predict will soon <em>create a paradigm shift in U.S. business</em> that could make you 5 to 10 times your money.</p>
					<p>It’ll change the way you eat, shop, work, talk, and more. A once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.</p>
					<p>I’ll show you exactly how to play my prediction using the Power Gauge.</p>
					<p>Last year alone, it pointed to Riot Blockchain before it shot up 10,090% in less than 12 months… Digital Turbine, before it shot up 789% in 8 months… Overstock.com, before it shot up 1,050% in 4 months… and more.</p>
					<p>See you on May 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>
